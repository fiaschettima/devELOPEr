To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.",

For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].\nGiven the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.\nYou must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.",
